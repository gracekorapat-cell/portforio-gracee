With this new feature complete, I think it would be cool to create a new blog post that you write in my style to showcase to other users how the feature was built using the advance tips used to build this current feature, code examples pulled straight from my repo, and more. It should be a tutorial that anybody can follow. In the end, they get a basic feature after reading. I don't want this to sound too AI-generated. Use other examples of my articles in this repo to guide the style. Use my custom MDX components as it makes sense. If the feature is complex enough, it may be good to showcase it and highlight it in the Changelog page. Create a new Changelog page item, summarize the feature, highlight the cool parts of it, and if an article was generated about the feature, make sure to link to it from the Changelog page. The changelog date of publication should be the current date.
