External links in blog posts now show screenshot previews on hover! Inspired by Wikipedia's link previews, this feature gives readers a glimpse of what's on the other side before they click.

Hover over any external link to see a preview with the page screenshot, favicon, and domain. You can even move your cursor onto the popover to keep it open. If a screenshot couldn't be captured (some sites block automated browsers), the link works normally without a preview.

Want to build this for your own site? Check out the full tutorial: [Build Link Previews with Playwright and the Popover API](/blog/build-link-previews-with-playwright-and-the-popover-api).
