Introducing a dedicated Stats page showcasing the numbers behind my website!

Explore metrics across four categories:

- **Blog Stats** — Total articles, words written, combined reading time, top viewed and most reacted articles, and a category breakdown chart
- **Engagement** — Site views with an upward trend visualization, reaction breakdowns by type, community wall messages, changelog updates, and days since the site revamp
- **GitHub** — Contribution graph, stars, forks, and total commits
- **Performance** — Real-time Lighthouse scores for both mobile and desktop, featuring a radar visualization

Each card features playful animations and hover interactions that bring the data to life.
