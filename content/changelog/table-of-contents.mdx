Long-form articles now feature a floating Table of Contents on desktop! As you scroll, a glowing dot smoothly animates to show which section you're currently reading.

Here's what makes it special:

- **Smart scroll tracking** — The active section updates as you read, using a performant scroll-based approach with `requestAnimationFrame` throttling
- **Visual hierarchy** — H2 headings appear at the top level, with H3 subsections indented beneath them
- **Springy animations** — The indicator uses a custom `cubic-bezier` easing that overshoots slightly before settling, giving it a playful feel
- **CSS Anchor Positioning** — Uses cutting-edge CSS as a progressive enhancement, falling back to JavaScript for older browsers
- **Accessibility-first** — Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and includes proper ARIA labels
